How to use the DF-xx instruments

Copy the code 'for Sonic Pi' into an empty buffer in Sonic Pi.
When using multiple instruments, copy them into different buffers.
Copy the code 'for Processing 3' into Processing3.

In Sonic Pi, run the code of all instruments you want to use.
in Processing 3, run the code, this should open the UI window.

Because all instruments get their heartbeat from the DF-00, it has to run always.
If you don't need it, turn down the volume or set all patterns to 'off'(this is the default.)


Please report any problems.
